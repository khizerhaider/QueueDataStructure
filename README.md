# Queue Data Structure Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Queue data structure in C++. The queue follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, where elements are added to the back (tail) and removed from the front.

## Features

- **Dynamic Size**: The queue is initialized with a maximum size and can handle elements until that limit is reached.
- **Circular Queue**: Utilizes a circular array to optimize space, allowing efficient usage of the array.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the queue, including options to enqueue, dequeue, check status, clear the queue, and get the first element.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- Basic understanding of C++ programming.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/queue-data-structure.git
   cd queue-data-structure
